# Project-4
Team Neural Net Ninjas

The project explores a synthetic dataset of 180,000 rows of data. Models included in my branch addressed:
- sales prediction with multiple linear regression & improving the model's fit & prediction power - data cleaning with bad data exclusion, turning from linear to multiple linear regression, addressing issues of multicoreality, outlier exclusion, testing for overfit, and finally reevaluating choice of variables in sales prediction modeling. 
- late delivery prediction with logistic regression - 
- fraud prediction model - using logistic regression, random forest, and XBoost. The fraud modeling is struggling to address the data imbalance and is plagued by issues of a large number of false positive identifications. The modeling includes SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler, class weight balancing and class weight balancing.

Data loaded into SQL PostgreSQL - schema & database design. 

Sales prediction data loaded and featured in Kaggle ntbk @ https://www.kaggle.com/code/vickyl86/sales-model

Additional folder: First_set_analysis - exploration of a data set initially chosen for the analysis - number of features and limited usability as explored in the notebook resulted in the team deciding to switch the dataset to the set ulimately found in the Resources folder.
